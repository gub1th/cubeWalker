Name: CubeWalker

Description: This is an endless 3D running game in which a player must strive to survive for as long as possible. The player must avoid stepping on illegal boundaries, which can be done through side-by-side evading or by building ramps 
to travel along. The player must also win duels against opponents when the opportunity arises, a situation of shoot or be shot. The goal is to earn as many points as possible; these points are earned through survival time, the winning 
of duels as well as shooting occasional stationary targets along the way.
